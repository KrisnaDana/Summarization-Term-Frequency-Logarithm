To create a corpus for summarization, you would need to collect a large number of texts that are relevant to the topic or domain you want to summarize. This could involve removing punctuation, stop words, and other irrelevant information from the texts. The training set would be used to train the summarization model, while the validation set would be used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as extractive summarization, which involves selecting and concatenating important sentences or phrases from the original texts, or abstractive summarization, which involves generating new sentences that capture the most important information from the original texts. Overall, creating a corpus for summarization involves collecting a large number of relevant texts, pre-processing the texts to clean and format the data, and splitting the corpus into training and validation sets.
